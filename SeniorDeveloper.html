							The objective of this project is to build a web page that suggests activities to the user 
							based on their preferences.
						</p>
						<p>
							To do so, you should leverage the <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/documentation" target="_blank">boredapi</a>. 
							This api will return one randomized activity at a time for the given preferences.  The returned 
							activity should be displayed to the user in an attractive way.  The following attributes of the activity 
							should be displayed:
							<ul>
								<li>Description</li>
								<li>Type (e.g. "education")</li>
								<li>Number of participants</li>
								<li>Relative price</li>
								<li>Link (if provided)</li>
								<li>Accessibility rating</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							Each time the user requests an activity, all previous activities should be collapsed 
							and display only their description.  If the user clicks on a collapsed activity, it should expand to show 
							the detail.
						</p>
                        <p>
                            The user should be able to specify the following preferences that are then passed to the api:
							<ul>
								<li>Type: <a href="https://www.boredapi.com/documentation#endpoints-accessibility-range" target="_blank">category</a></li>
								<li>Number of participants: unsigned integer</li>
								<li>Relative price: range (free -> expensive)</li>
								<li>Accessibility rating: range (most -> least)</li>
							</ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can use any libraries, frameworks, languages, etc. that you would like as long as the end result
							is a web page. You may use any written or web resources but if you sample code please cite all uses 
							in the comments.  You may <i>not</i> get help from other people - we want to see <i>your</i> code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The final product will be assessed in three areas in order of importance:
							<ol>
								<li>
									Functionality as defined by specification
								</li>
								<li>
									Ease of use and workflow clarity
								</li>
								<li>
									Styling, responsiveness and structure
								</li>
							</ol>
                        </p>

							Add the ability to "favorite" an activity.  Favorited activities should 
							be persisted across page refresh and accessible to the user.  Only 
							the activity "key" and description should be stored.  Favorited 
							activities should display as "collapsed" and make a request to 
							the api to pull the details when clicked.
